# FHN_nonlocal_coupling
FitzHugh-Nagumo spatial model with nonlocal coupling [http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6508] .

Future plans: 
-
[2 Aug 2015]:
add different Kernels (presumably case-switch scenario), also add various initial waves
(case-switch either). Display all of these on the form in textboxes, 
more likely giving some area around each one with a variety of alterable parameters 
(e.g. "a sin(b x) + c cos(d x): a = ..., b =..., c =..., d =...").
